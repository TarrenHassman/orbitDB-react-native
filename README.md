# Non-Federated

Federated systems are the equivalent of republics.

Considering our current situation in relation to republics I would hope you could understand why I do not consider them to be an ideal system.

I believe all individuals should be able to participate fully in the network easily with what they have (It is not uncommon to not have a laptop let alone a powerful desktop computer)


# Crypto

Using crypto wallets as authentication allow a divestment from major corporations like Google, Meta, and Apple

Participation in cryptocurrency is not a requirement.

The wallets function are for account verification, post signing, etc.

# Polyfill

Libp2p and Helia rely on packages not available on browsers.

Polyfills are handled in the metro.config.js and bable.config.js

metro.config.js handles loading packages

bable.config.js handles aliases

# Attributions
Cyberfly.io - Setting up Polyfills to replace the previous method of just bundling up an entire nodejs enviroment


# TODO
